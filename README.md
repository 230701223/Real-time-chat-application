The real-time chat application was built to simulate instant messaging functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on responsive UI and real-time interaction. I utilized WebSocket or Firebase Realtime Database (depending on the version) to enable instant message exchange between users. The design includes a clean chat interface, timestamped messages, user identification, and auto-scrolling. This project helped me understand asynchronous data flow, event-driven programming, and real-time web communication, which are critical concepts in dynamic web applications.
